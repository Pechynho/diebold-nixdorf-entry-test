# Diebold Nixdorf Entry test
This is a C# Console Application which I have created for a job interview in the [Diebold Nixdorf](https://www.dieboldnixdorf.com/).
It is a simple application which allows to store information about users (ID, username and password). There are 4 commands which can be used
to manipulate with database: list, add, login and delete. The UI is in Czech language. Things which could be usefull or interesting:
- Application uses Entity Framework with SQLite
- There is implemented [Repository pattern](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404154203/https://www.remondo.net/repository-pattern-example-csharp/)
- Application uses [Dependency Injection](https://andrewlock.net/using-dependency-injection-in-a-net-core-console-application/)
